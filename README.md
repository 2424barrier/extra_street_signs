# Extra Street Signs 

This mod adds EU sign variants to luanti, without clashing with existing mods. Crafting recipes not available /yet/, more 'US' sign variants expected in the future.

**WARNING: This mod _will_ convert 'streets:sign_eu' and 'streets:sign_us' signs to extra_street_sign nodes automatically.**
**NOTE: This mod _won't_ run if streets by webdesigner is installed.** 

## Contributors (from https://github.com/minetest-mods/streets.git)

NOTE: None of the textures have been modified in extra_street_signs from streets, only renamed and reprogrammed to serve new purpose.
