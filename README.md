# Extra Street Signs 

This mod adds EU sign variants to luanti (from https://github.com/minetest-mods/streets), without clashing with existing mods. Crafting recipes not available /yet/, more 'US' sign variants expected in the future.

**NOTE: Mod will _not_ work with 'streets' by webdesigner, and will convert EU signs on load.**
